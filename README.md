## Usage

Either [open the HTML](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dcog989/Goat-Theme-Editor/145b25d06f8ea4c42ad4f7278e02cbe727ac6add/Goat%20Theme%20Editor.html), or [download the files](https://github.com/dcog989/Goat-Theme-Editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to use it locally.

Tested on [Ditto Clipboard Manager](https://github.com/sabrogden/Ditto/), and [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus). All good from my testing, but would recommend checking output with [WinMerge](https://github.com/WinMerge/winmerge).
